Important UI points to constantly refer back to:

-'10 UI Design Heuristics'.

-Cards or lists: when and when not to use.

-F-pattern vs Z-pattern: directing the user's eyes based on whether page is either text-heavy OR has more white space.

-Typography, LINE-HEIGHT!!!, Negative Space <-- this is huge.

-WHITE SPACE IS OFTEN MORE IMPORTANT than making important items BIGGER and BOLDER.

-Color:
    Choice and usage of MAIN color, then ACCENTS(see the various types of color harmony categories).
    NEUTRAL colors-- text, bg, outlines, borders.
    Don't rely solely on color to communicate meaning!

-Utilize all the useful tools listed at end of each week's lessons (on class website). Note: colormind.io is not very dependable 
for generating great color schemes.

-Don't forget about Contrast & Accessibility. Contrast checkers, accessible colors.
